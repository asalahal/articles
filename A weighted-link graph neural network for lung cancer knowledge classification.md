Abstract
Visualized              knowledge              representation              can              more              effectively              help              the              public              gain              knowledge              about              lung              cancer              prevention,
diagnosis,          treatment,          and           subsequent          life.           Therefore,           this          study           collected           articles          on          lung          cancer          from          the           well-known           Web           of
Science            database            to            analyze            lung            cancer            literature,            and            the            text            data            were            published            between            2016            and            2021.            First,            we            used
natural        language        processing        to        handle        the        collected        text        data,        and        then        we        used        the        latent        Dirichlet        allocation        method        to        perform
topic           modeling          and           obtain           the           optimal           topic           numbers           based           on          two           coherence           metrics           for           assigning           the           class           of           every           article.
Next,         a        PMI_2        weighted        was         proposed        to        build        an        initial         weighted        knowledge         graph,        and        four        graph        neural        network        algorithms
were        used        to        train         the         initial         weighted        knowledge         graph.        In        addition,        we        proposed        a         PMI_2              +              link        to        improve         the         classification
performance,            and            the            additional            links            were            obtained            from            the            graph            auto-encoder            and            graph            convolutional            network            training.
When       the       best       classification       performance       has       been       obtained,       these       edge       weights       have       a       representative.        For       visualized       knowledge
representation,        we       used       the        Neo4j        tool       to       display        the        nodes        and        edge       weights        for        the        final       literature       knowledge.        The       results        show
that      the       use       of      the      proposed      PMI_2            +            link      to      build       a       weighted      graph       has       a       better      classification      performance.      Further,      the       proposed
PMI_2               +               link         can         effectively         reduce         the         number         of         edges         on         the         knowledge         graphs         and         avoid          insufficient         GPU         memory.
