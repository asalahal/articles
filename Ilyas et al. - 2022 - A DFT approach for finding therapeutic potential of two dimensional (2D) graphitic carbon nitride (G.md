**1.** **Introduction**



a b s t r a c t


The density functional theory (DFT) analysis is used to predict the therapeutic potential of Graphitic
carbon nitride (GCN) as a medicinal carrier for curcumin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
To evaluate the drug transport capacity of GCN, the electronic, ground, and excited-state properties of
curcumin, GCN, and the GCN-curcumin-complex were investigated. The adsorption energy of the GCNcurcumin-complex is higher in the gas phase (−0.25 eV) than in the aqueous phase (−0.09 eV), implying
that the GCN-curcumin-complex is more stable in the gas phase. Weak N–H bonds anchored the curcumin at GCN surface. The GCN-curcumin-complex has a higher dipole moment in the aqueous medium
(2.37 D) than in the gas phase (1.36 D) which aids in the efficient transport of the drug through biological systems. Molecular electrostatic potential and frontier molecular orbitals revealed that during
excitation, curcumin behaves as a HOMO, transferring charge to the LUMO (GCN). The charge decomposition analysis, which determines the highest overlap between the curcumin and GCN orbitals, was also
employed to investigate the charge transfer process. For several transitions from the donor to the acceptor, Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was transferred between the curcumin and
GCN molecules. For the GCN-curcumin-complex, excited-state calculations show that _λ_ max is redshifted
by 131 nm. The redshift for the GCN-curcumin-complex in the solvent phase is 149 nm. The theoretically generated spectra match experimentally observed spectra quite well. Moreover, the in silico infrared
spectra of GCN and Curcumin is also close to the experimental spectra. For the graphical explanation
of various excited states, electron-hole and photoinduced electron-transfer analysis are performed. The
Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism perceives quenching of fluorescence because of an interaction. Moreover, GCN +1/−1 showed little structural change and produces stable curcumin complexes.
All findings indicated that GCN has substantial therapeutic potential as a carrier for curcumin in cardiovascular disease cure. Researchers will be motivated to investigate alternative 2D nanomaterials for drug
delivery applications due to this theoretical study.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has now become a leading cause
of death all over the world. It is estimated that almost 17.9 million

people die every year, which is 31% of all causalities that occur
in the world due to CVDs [1]. Hypertension, stroke, and a limita

tion or obstruction of blood supply in a particular region are common examples of cardiovascular disorders that affect many people.
These illnesses are the leading causes of long-term disability and
death [2]. Various drug treatments for the cure of these disorders
are known, with most of them relying on synthetic active compounds.
Nevertheless, when these medications are used, they frequently
cause negative side effects. As a result of this fact, scientists have
conducted various studies to discover better therapeutic alternatives. The development of CVD medicines has now become the

main priority in the face of this critical situation [3]. In this
case, using nanotechnology as an interesting and groundbreaking
method for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases makes sense.
Nanoscience understanding and application in medicine seeks to
improve the cure of these diseases without a doubt [4].
Nanotechnology has a wide range of uses in medicine, including
diagnosis and imaging, analytical purposes, and treatment techniques, including gene delivery systems, targeted drug delivery,
and tissue engineering scaffolds [5]. Nanoparticles have garnered
a lot of interest in biology because of their advantageous physicochemical properties (roughness, reactivity, high surface energy, and
high surface-to-volume ratio). Nanomedicine is a cutting-edge area
that allows for the early detection, treatment, and management of
diseases and disorders in order to promote health and well-being.
Medical nanoparticles have innumerable benefits over conventional
and contemporary medical procedures. These benefits include extended drug half-life, lower toxicity, improved nanoparticle biocompatibility, and fewer side effects [6]. In addition, targeted delivery via active or passive targeting using nanocarriers seems to
be an advantageous treatment method. Active drug targeting necessitates drug binding to a cell-specific binding site linked to a
nanoparticle [7]. A high molecular weight compound is used in
passive targeting to deliver drugs that can percolate and persist
in the tissue for better results [8]. Compared to the bulk rivals,
nanoparticles ranging in size from 1 nm to 100 nm have interesting characteristics. They can pass across biological membranes,
cells, and tissues [9]. Surface modification of nanoparticles may be
used to illustrate their physical properties. Because of their exceptional features, nanomaterials have been used as a theragnostic agent, drug carrier, diagnostic, and in different pharmaceutical applications. For instance, nanoparticles with a high surface-tovolume ratio allow drug molecules to be conjugated, absorbed, or
encapsulated for delivery to main target site [10]. Drug carriers are
used because of their ability to carry weakly soluble or extremely
noxious substances to the target sites [11].
Because of the interesting associations to biological systems,
like their resemblance in size to biological structures, fast penetration through the membrane, better water solubility, which reduces
the level of cytotoxicity, and large-circulation times, nanocarriers
made of nanomaterials for drugs have had an exclusive effect on
cardiovascular treatment [12–14]. Additionally, changes in pharmacokinetics improve therapy outcomes by increasing the amount of
the therapeutic agent in cells, targeting the drug to a particular
location, and retaining the drug’s concentration at that site for
the requisite duration, allowing for improved drug-action effects

[15–17]. The shape of nanocarriers is important for making them
long-lasting, biocompatible, and effective at drug off-loading at the
target site [18]. Drug loading and tailored distribution at specific
places piqued researchers’ interest [19,20]. Two-dimensional (2D)
nanomaterials with different chemical, physical, and mechanical
properties are suitable for cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy in
this regard. Graphene, graphene oxide, MoS2, MXenes, Bi2Se3, and
phosphorene (B.P), and h-BN are two-dimensional nanomaterials
with a planer shape. These are good nanocarriers with a strong potential in systematic delivery [21]. Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN),
an allotropic form of carbon nitride (C3N4), is a metal-free material with a 2.7 eV bandgap and a significant surface area to volume
ratio in the category of 2D nanomaterials, is also putting its foot
forth to better the quality of life [22,23]. GCN was considered the
reliable form among different allotropes of C3N4 (i.e., graphite-like
structures, and _α_, _β_ -phase) [24,25]. Two structural models for GCN
have been suggested, one with triazine units and the other with
heptazine rings (tri-s-triazine), predicted to be favored GCN structure building blocks [25,26]. C4N4 has recently been added to the
list of carbon-nitride (CN) compounds that are thought to be more
thermally and dynamically stable than CN with a 3:4 stoichiometry



(C3N4) [27]. The structure of GCN with heptazine rings was used
in this study as the carbon-nitride structure. The simplest structure of GCN and its controllable bandgap and better optoelectronic
properties makes it a biocompatible and far less toxic substance.
Since only C and N are components of GCN, its natural toxicity is
incredibly low and can be metabolize easily in biological systems

[28,29]. GCN is a good material for biomedical applications because
of its low bio-toxicity and good biocompatibility, particularly in the
context of cardiovascular treatment [30].
Moreover, GCN has a similar structure to graphene, and it has
received much attention owing to its excellent properties [31]. In
addition to its beneficial properties such as a greater surface area
to volume ratio and strong biocompatibility, GCN can be used as a
nanocarrier by loading therapeutic compounds or medications into
the cavities to create a complex system. Weak attraction forces,
such as London dispersion forces, are used to load drug molecules
or therapeutic agents onto nanocarriers.
PET and PCT phenomena are extremely important in living systems because they influence the dynamics of certain phenomena
like phosphorescence and fluorescence [32–35]. For instance, if
electrons or charges pass from a chelator to a fluorophore, it causes
fluorescence quenching [36,37]. The optical and fluorescence detection of nanocarriers and drugs is critical in the systemic delivery of a drug. Since UV-light is detrimental to biological systems,
electron-transfer (excitation) wavelengths are given preference in
the visible region [38–40]. Natural products have gained a lot of
attention from many drugs because they delay the development
of cost-effective CVDs. Natural products in CVD medication have a
broader range of effects than synthetic medicines, with fewer side
effects [41]. Curcumin, a bioactive ingredient of turmeric, has been
extensively researched for its wide range of therapeutic benefits.
Curcumin is used to treat various ailments, including cold, cough,
jaundice, hepatic conditions, and inflammatory diseases [42]. Furthermore, due to its pleiotropic effects, this phytochemical is wellknown for treating CVDs. Aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction,
heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetic
cardiovascular problems, and drug-induced cardiotoxicity are all
prevented by this powerful phytochemical [43]. Histone acetyltransferases (p300), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), Nuclear
factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and transcription factor
(NF-B) are all molecular targets of Curcumin in CVDs. Curcumin’s
use to prevent CVDs has been limited in clinical trials because of
its poor solubility and bioavailability [44]. Hence, researchers concentrate on producing novel nanocarriers to enhance clinical results and lower the risk of CVD drugs [45]. DFT approach was used
to assess the drug-delivery performance of GCN for curcumin.


**2.** **Computational** **details**


The density functional theory was used to perform all of the
calculations [46] with the Gaussian 09 program [47]. B3LYP functional [48] was used in combination with the 6–31G (d, p) basis set
to perform geometry optimization [49]. For geometry optimization,
the GCN model structure is used. Numerous alternate orientations
of Curcumin on GCN were considered to find the most stable structure. TD-DFT (Time dependent-DFT) at TD-B3LYP/6–31G (d, p) was
utilized to measure excited-state characteristics. Adsorption energy
is perhaps the most powerful tool for determining the types of interactions among the various components involved in the complex
formulation. The following expression was utilized to calculate the
adsorption energies [50] for optimized complexes [51]:

_E_ _ad_ = _E_ _GCN_ − _Curcumin_ − [�] _E_ _GCN_ + _E_ _g_ − _Curcumin_ �

tively. The total or free-energy values of the systems are useful
in determining _E_ _ad_ . The influence of the solvent on the interaction behavior of Curcumin with carrier GCN was examined uti
lizing an IEFPCM [52]. The energies of HOMO–LUMO orbitals, as
well as some other significant characteristics such as dipole moment, chemical softness, chemical potential, hardness, and globalelectrophilicity, were determined in the gas and solvent phases for
Curcumin, GCN, and complex. In addition, the stability of the GCNcurcumin complex is calculated using the following formula [53]:


_�_ _E_ _sol_ _v_ _ation_ = _E_ _sol_ − _E_ _gas_


where _E_ _gas_ and _E_ _sol_ signify the total energies of systems in the
gas and solvent phases, respectively, and _E_ _Solvation_ signifies the system’s solvation energy. The electron density of GCN after forming
a complex molecule was studied and visualized using the Electron localization function (ELF) [54,55]. Validation of above all optimized molecular frameworks was carried out using frequency calculations of IR-Spectra by employing DFT method B3LYP/6–31G (d,
p). Curcumin and GCN had an impact on MO energy levels, as
well as ligand-field splitting for the GCN-curcumin-complex, according to CDA [56]. NBO analysis was used to investigate intermolecular orbital interactions, such as charge transfer in the complex. Transitions from curcumin to GCN, as well as transitions
from GCN to curcumin and within the GCN, were studied [57,58].
The UV–visible spectrum of curcumin, GCN, and GCN–Curcumin
complex were measured in both gaseous and aqueous phases. At
B3LYP/6–31G (d, p), noncovalent interactions (NCI analysis), as well
as PET and PCT operations, were investigated. This research also
looked at the impact of charges (+1 and −1) of optimized geometries under study. The distribution of charges for complex compounds was examined using an atomic dipole-moment correctedHirshfeld (ADCH) population. This approach was chosen for the
study because of its stupendous ability to solve problems pertinent
to Hirshfeld-weak charge’s dipole moment reproducibility. Charge
levels obtained by ADCH analysis are more trustworthy [59,60].


**3.** **Result** **and** **discussions**


_3.1._ _Optimized_ _geometry_ _and_ _adsorption_ _energy_


_3.1.1._ _Gas-phase_

Fig. 1 shows the optimized geometries of GCN and GCNcurcumin complex. According to the optimized structure of the



complex, curcumin linked to GCN with non-covalent N—H interactions, where curcumin serves as a hydrogen bond donor. As
curcumin adsorbed on GCN surface, two N—H non-covalent interactions were found. With distances of 2.62 A [˚] and 2.64 A, [˚] the
two hydrogens of curcumin interact with GCN atoms. For the
GCN-curcumin complex, the measured adsorption energy [50] is
−0.25 eV. This _E_ _ad_ value indicates the thermodynamic stability
of complex (GCN-curcumin) in the gas phase. We compared the
Ead of GCN-curcumin-complex with the adsorption energies reported in the literature for GCN carrier on different drugs. The Ead
reported for cisplatin/GCN complex in gaseous phase was about
−1.25 eV [61]. This suggest that our complex will release drug easily. Furthermore, the curcumin is well adsorbed on GCN. However,
the adsorption of curcumin is not enough strong to make drug release difficult. The drug interacts with the GCN carrier molecule in
a noncovalent manner. As a result, the drug can efficiently offload
from the carrier with this _E_ _ad_ value. Nevertheless, several drug release mechanisms can be used. Since it is not extremely deleterious and has higher selectivity with manageable changes, the lightinduced process would be useful for controlling drug release [62].
For the adsorption and distribution of slow-release medicines, adsorption energies of about −30 kcal/mol (−1.30 eV) are adequate

[63]. The determined _E_ _ad_ value for GCN-curcumin-complex anticipate that our medication has adequate drug release. Visible light
irradiation can be beneficial in overcoming the problems associated with drug release within the body. The photothermal action
caused by this visible light irradiation can result in controlled release just at the target spot. As a result, we can suggest that our
GCN-curcumin-complex is sufficiently stable to be utilized as a curcumin carrier.


_3.1.2._ _Solvent_ _phase_
The impact of the solvent on the behavior of curcumin’s interactions with the GCN, the solubility, and stability of the complex (GCN-curcumin) was explored. Water is being used to create a system that mimics the body’s metabolic state since it is
an integral component of the human body. The determined adsorption energy [50] for the GCN-curcumin complex in the aqueous environment is −0.09 eV. The negative value of _E_ _ad_ indicates
that curcumin adsorption at the GCN is exothermic. In the aqueous phase, the complex has a lower adsorption energy (−0.09 eV)
than in the gas phase (−0.25 eV), implying that the complex’s stability in water is somewhat diminished. Adsorption energies of the

GCN-curcumin in gaseous and solvent media do not vary significantly. The GCN-curcumin complex is stable in both mediums, and
the adsorption mechanism is favored thermodynamically. The solvation energy is used to measure the solubility of a compound in
a solvent. The higher the degree of solubility, the lower the solvation energy and vice versa. The solvation energies ( _E_ _Solvation_ ) of
curcumin, GCN carrier, and GCN-curcumin-complex were also estimated. The solvation energies of the curcumin drug and the GCN
carrier are −0.75 eV and −1.43 eV, respectively. The GCN-curcumin
complex has a solvation energy of −2.03 eV. Both the curcumin
drug and the GCN carrier, as well as the GCN-curcumin complex,
have negative solvation energy values, indicating that the complex’s solvation is a spontaneous process, and that water stabilizes
the GCN-curcumin complex. When compared to free curcumin
drug molecule and GCN carrier, _E_ _Solvation_ of the GCN-curcumin complex decreases as curcumin drug is placed on the carrier surface.
As a result, it can be stated that both the curcumin medication
and the GCN carrier have higher solubility in the solvent system.


_3.2._ _HOMO–LUMO_ _analysis_


_3.2.1._ _Gas_ _phase_
Because the frontier molecular orbitals play an important part
in shaping a molecule’s optical and electrical properties, their
energy (i.e., the HOMO–LUMO energy bandgap _E_ _g_ ) is frequently
used to assess a molecule’s kinetic stability, chemical reactivity,
and chemical hardness [64,65]. A molecule with a narrow energy
bandgap is a soft molecule because it has a strong chemical reactivity and a low kinetic stability [66]. The decrease in the energy gap in this method indicates significant intramolecular charge
transfer within the molecule, representing a molecule’s bioactivity.
Hence, _E_ _LUMO_ _,_ _E_ _HOMO_, and their energy gap _E_ _g_ were determined for
Curcumin (drug), GCN [67], and GCN–Curcumin complex. Fig. 2 depicts asymmetric LUMO and HOMO for GCN, Curcumin, and GCNcurcumin-complex, whereby green, and red colored distributions
represent the positive and negative phases of FMOs wave function, respectively. The HOMO is found on a curcumin region with
significant densities-separation for a complex molecule. The LUMO
is seen on GCN, indicating that the curcumin molecule has transferred its charge to GCN.

Table 1 represents the absorption wavelength ( _λ_ max ), _E_ _g_, and
HOMO–LUMO energies of the carrier, drug, and complex molecule
in the gaseous phase. The energy gap of Curcumin is 3.32 eV, having energy values −5.28 eV (HOMO) and −1.96 eV (LUMO). GCN
has an energy gap of 3.89 eV, with energy values of −6.10 eV
(HOMO) and −2.21 eV (LUMO).
The GCN-curcumin-complex has less band gap (2.84 eV) as
compared to Curcumin (3.32 eV), and GCN (3.89 eV), which tells
that amount of energy required for the excitation of a GCN

curcumin-complex is less as compared to Curcumin and GCN separately. The LUMO and HOMO energies of the GCN-curcumincomplex are like those of GCN and Curcumin, respectively. Surprisingly, this structure matches molecular orbital densities: the
LUMO is on GCN, while the HOMO is on curcumin. In the UV–vis
spectrum, the maximum absorption ( _λ_ max ) of the GCN carrier was
288 nm, while GCN-curcumin (complex) was 131 nm red-shifted
from the carrier and had a maximum absorption ( _λ_ max ) of 419 nm.
The reduction in bandgap in GCN-curcumin-complex triggers this
redshifted excitation wavelength.


_3.2.2._ _Solvent_ _phase_

Table 2 shows the frontier molecular orbitals energies, the
bandgap ( _E_ _g_ ) of the GCN-curcumin-complex, the carrier GCN, and
curcumin, as well as the absorption wavelength in the aqueous phase. In the aqueous media, the FMOs energies and the
bandgap ( _E_ _g_ ) of the GCN-curcumin-complex, carrier GCN, and curcumin are intimately associated with the data achieved as in the
gas phase. The complex molecule bandgap in the aqueous phase
(2.97 eV) is higher as compared to the bandgap ( _E_ _g_ ) in the gaseous
phase (2.84 eV), suggesting that GCN-curcumin reactivity is decreased to a lesser degree in the aqueous environment. The energy bandgap ( _E_ _g_ ) in the gas phase (2.84 eV) is higher than the
complex band gap in the aqueous environment (2.97 eV), showing
that GCN-curcumin reactivity is reduced in the aqueous environment to some extent. The GCN carrier has a maximum absorption
of 285 nm, while GCN-curcumin showed 149 nm red-shifted from
the carrier with a maximum absorption of 434 nm. Figure S1 of
supporting information represent the HOMO and LUMO of GCNcurcumin in the aqueous phase.


_3.3._ _Molecular_ _electrostatic_ _potential_ _(MEP)_ _diagram_ _and_ _I.R_ _spectra_


The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) was used to investigate reactivity towards nucleophilic or electrophilic attacks. The
electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks are promoted by MEPs’ negative and positive sections, which are indicated in red and blue
colors, respectively. The H-acceptor and H-donor properties of the
molecules can be predicted by help of the negative and positive
regions of the MEP diagram. As a result, the electrostatic potential
is critical in the formation of a hydrogen bond.
The MEPs diagrams of Curcumin, GCN, and GCN-curcumincomplex are given in the Fig. 3. The MEP of Curcumin reveals
that the concentration of the positive region is abundant on oxygen atoms directly attached to protons. It implies that these are
sites for a nucleophilic attack that can operate as proton donors.
The negative areas on the GCN are distributed over the surface of
the nitrogen atoms, suggesting its nucleophilic character and capacity to establish hydrogen bonds with Curcumin. The I.R. spectra

of Curcumin, GCN, and GCN-curcumin complex are represented in
Fig. 4. The Figure shows that the spectra of the complex are different from the spectra of drug and carrier. The absence of Curcumin and GCN peaks in complex formation anticipate a bonding
between carrier and complex, which makes it different from both.


_3.4._ _Charge_ _decomposition_ _analysis_ _(CDA)_ _and_ _density_ _of_ _state_ _(DOS)_


Intramolecular charge transfer is enabled by the lower energy
gap of complex. Because of the introduction of new molecular



energy levels in the complex’s MOs from drug and carrier components, as seen from the CDA-diagram, transfer of charges take
place. By developing an orbital-interaction diagram of the GCNcurcumin-complex in CDA analysis, the orbital influences from Curcumin and GCN for forming the complex molecule were determined. Due to the introduction of new MO energy levels by GCN
and Curcumin, the LUMO energy decreases (−2.28 eV) and the
HOMO energy increases (−5.12 eV) in the GCN-curcumin complex. The energy gap ( _E_ _g_ ) of the GCN-curcumin-complex is reduced
(2.84 eV) due to this addition, making the charge transfer process

easier. The DOS analysis shows, Curcumin is efficiently adsorbed
onto GCN (M.O.s of GCN and Curcumin are merged) and produces
new M.O.s of GCN-curcumin-complex, as a result of which the energy gap is narrowed (2.84 eV) for GCN-curcumin-complex, which
further accelerates the charge transfer process.



These new molecular levels, which are connected with the
HOMO and LUMO orbitals in the CDA Fig. 5, were largely produced by the adsorbed curcumin medicine (as the CDA diagram
also indicates that the GCN-curcumin-complex molecule has the
emergence of new molecular orbitals). The DOS diagram (Fig. 6)

and the CDA diagram (Fig. 7) are very similar. These findings
suggested that the curcumin drug was well linked to the GCN
carrier.


_3.5._ _Chemical_ _stability_ _parameter_ _(_ _μ_ _,_ _η_ _,_ _s,_ _ω_ _)_ _and_ _dipole_ _moment_


A molecule’s hardness ( _η_ ) is related to its resistance to changes
in electrical distribution, whereas the molecule’s softness (s) is
the opposite of hardness. Chemical stability (larger-bandgap) of
the molecule is associated with hardness, while chemical reactivity
(small bandgap) is associated with softness [68]. The electrophilicity index ( _ω_ ) evaluates compound’s capacity to accept electrons,



and the chemical-potential ( _μ_ ) shows the direction of flow of electrons [69]. A good-electrophile molecule has a high value of _μ_, _ω_,
whereas a good-nucleophile molecule has a low value of _μ_, _ω_ [70].
Curcumin, GCN, and the GCN-curcumin complex has dipole moments of 2.53, 1.82, and 1.36 Debye, respectively. The complex has
a high softness (hardness) of 0.35 eV [−][1] (1.42 eV), compared to the
GCN 0.26eV [−][1] (1.95 eV) and curcumin 0.30eV [−][1] (1.66 eV), indicating that the complex is more reactive and hence less stable than
the Curcumin and GCN. The higher value of GCN-curcumin complex for _ω_ (4.80) and _μ_ (−3.70) than GCN ( _ω_ =4.14 and _μ_ =−4.15)
suggests that complex behave as a good electrophile. The softness,
hardness, and electronegativity of the target area and drug can

be used to determine the inherited targeted spot. The chemicalpotential ( _μ_ ), electrophilicity-index ( _ω_ ), hardness ( _η_ ), dipole moment and softness (s) of the carrier (GCN), drug (Curcumin), and
complex (GCN-curcumin) were estimated in gaseous phase utilizing DFT and are represented in Table 1. The graphical representa

their dipole moment increased (GCN=2.82D, Drug=3.70D, and
complex=2.37D), indicating higher reactivity and higher stability of
these into the water phase. The minor decrease in chemical softness (0.33) and increase in chemical hardness (1.48) of the GCNcurcumin complex anticipate the higher stability of the complex in
the water phase. Moreover, in the aqueous phase, the increase in
electrophilicity index (5.21) suggests the stronger electrophilicity
of GCN-curcumin complex. The graphical representation of these
parameters in solvent phase is shown in supporting information
Figure S3.


_3.6._ _NCI_ _and_ _RDG_ _analysis_


The NCI (non-covalent interactions) differentiated from the
strong identified interatomic interactions by looking at the NCI
plot [71]. It describes the local-bonding characteristics of the compounds, and the NCI approach uses two scalar fields: the electron density (r) and the RDG (s). The stiletto-heel shape is determined by NCI graphical representations between r and s [72,73].
Low value of r and s denote weak interactions, whereas, low value
of r and high value of s denote non-interacting density regions,
and low value of s and high value of r denote covalent interactions. The 2-d-NCI plot also distinguishes between attractive (Hbonding) and repulsive interactions (steric hindrance) [74] based
on the second-density sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ Electron-density multiplied by
Hessian eigenvalue (r). If the sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ is greater than zero, there
is repulsive/steric hindrance, [73] if the sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ is zero than
weak van der Waals interactions, and between complex fragments,
there is an attractive hydrogen bonding if the sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ _<_ 0 [75].
To display 3-D NCI, the RDG-isosurface diagram (which explains
the fusion of the orbitals of the carrier and drug in a complex
molecule), the constant-density method is used with a value of s
0.5. Green for steric hindrance, blue for weak interactions, and red
for H-bonds, are the colors used to rank the interactions [76]. The
NCI-RDG geometrical analysis indicates that weak hydrogen bonds
between the carrier and the drug can be easily broken and the
drug can reach its target [71].
For the GCN-curcumin-complex, a two-dimensional NCI scatterplot of RDG versus sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ is drawn, yielding a characteristic
stiletto-heel-shape-plot as illustrated in Fig. 7. For both Curcumin
and GCN, this demonstrates that when sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ is zero, it indicates weak van der Waals forces of contact, sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ 0.025 is
greater than zero indicates steric hindrance, and sign ( _λ_ 2) _ρ_ −0.02
is lesser than zero indicates weak hydrogen bonding among complex components. Because of the weak connections and H-bonding
between the Curcumin H-atom and the N-atom of GCN, the drug
molecule can readily be released and delivered to its target area.
In Fig. 8, the 3D isosurface of GCN-curcumin is depicted.


_3.7._ _ELF_ _(electron-localization_ _function)_ _and_ _NBO_ _analysis_


ELF is denoted as _τ_ (r) and is dependent on the kinetic energy
density [77]. Delocalization and localization of electrons can both
be measured using this value [78]. Locations with bonding and
nonbonding localized electrons have ELF range of 0.5–1.0. The covalent bonds, a lone pair, or a nucleus-shell at specific areas might
produce electron localization. Locations with weak van der Waals
interactions have an ELF value of 0.0–0.5 and spaces between electron shells where electron delocalization arises [79]. ELF analysis
is used to analyze the relocation of the _π_ -system in the GCNcurcumin-complex molecule (Fig. 9). Carbon atoms exhibit high
ELF _>_ 0.5 values, indicating that nonbonding and bonding electrons
are densely concentrated in these sites. Two regions have low ELF
values of less than 0.5. The red region within the blue area containing N-atoms indicated delocalization in those nitrogen-atoms,



and the isolated blue-area over a few carbon-atoms represented
delocalization in those C-atoms. In the NBO study, these ELF images are very helpful in explaining the transition from drug to
a carrier and from carrier to the drug. The NBO analysis investigated the virtual orbital spaces and filled-orbitals, which can help
in intramolecular and intermolecular interaction studies [80]. The
electron density of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms in GCN
changes as a result of these transitions. Table 3 shows the energy
shifts in GCN for internal transitions before and after the complex
is generated.


_3.8._ _Photo-physical_ _properties_


_3.8.1._ _Gas-phase_

Fig. 10A shows the UV–vis spectra of Curcumin, GCN, and the
GCN–curcumin complex. Radiation with a wavelength of 419 nm is
absorbed by the GCN-curcumin complex, which is higher than Curcumin (410 nm). The values of maximum absorption wavelength
of the GCN-curcumin complex at 419 nm almost resemble its band
gap. In other words, maximum absorption at 419 nm corresponds
to 2.84 eV energy which is consistent with the band gap of HOMO
and LUMO. The absorption at this wavelength is responsible for the
excitation of electron from HOMO to LUMO. It can be inferred that

smaller the energy gap, the higher will be the wavelength of light
absorbed. In the UV–vis section, the carrier GCN had a maximum
absorption wavelength ( _λ_ max) of 288 nm. In comparison, GCNcurcumin had a maximum absorption-wavelength (max) of 419 nm
and a redshifted excitation-wavelength of 131 nm from the carrier. The reduction in the bandgap in the GCN-curcumin-complex
causes redshifted excitation wavelength.


_3.8.2._ _Solvent_ _phase_
The TD-DFT method was utilized to determine the ultraviolet

visible spectrum of GCN-curcumin, GCN, and curcumin in aqueous phase, revealing the effect of solvent on the energy changes
of excited states. The 434 nm, 285 nm, and 431 nm are the maximum wavelengths for GCN-curcumin, GCN, and curcumin, respectively. As GCN has a maximum wavelength of 285 nm, whereas
GCN-curcumin-complex has a maximum wavelength of 434 nm,
the redshift in aqueous media is 149 nm. The published reported
value for curcumin _λ_ max is 427 nm [82], while _λ_ max of GCN
is between 200 and 450 nm [83]. When the calculated UV–vis
values of Curcumin in gaseous ( _λ_ max = 410 nm) and aqueous
( _λ_ max = 431 nm) phases are compared to the published experimental value ( _λ_ max = 427 nm), it is found that these are quite
close. Furthermore, the theoretically predicted maximum absorption of GCN in the gaseous phase ( _λ_ max = 288 nm) and aqueous
phase ( _λ_ max = 285 nm) matches the observed value quite well
(200–450 nm). The fluorescence and colorimetric identification of
several bio-analytes (e.g., DNA, proteins, and inorganic ions,) would
benefit from notable fluctuations in absorption spectra which improve target specificity of the complex [84].


_3.9._ _PET_ _analysis_


The biological activity of a drug-carrier complex can be determined by analyzing its electronic excitations [85]. The molecularorbital theory is the foundation of the electron-hole theory. The
electron-hole theory is useful for identifying the mechanism of
electron transfer as well as the contributions of the electron and

hole orbitals in the singlet-excited state [86,87]. Fig. 11 depicts
orbitals of GCN-curcumin for five excited states, with the results
provided in Table 4. In case of GCN, LUMO is still intact, while
HOMO is visible on the curcumin treatment. The GCN-curcumin
complex has a maximum-absorption at 420 nm with 0.5663 F in

the gaseous phase. For the five excited-states, the distance observed between the electron-hole orbital of the complex is large
e.g., distances for 5 excited states are 4.02, 4.68, 4.37, 9.33, and
4.16 A [˚] demonstrating a long charge transfer length. For the five excited states, the orbitals-overlap-integral-(S) is smaller (0.07, 0.04,
0.20, 0.03, and 0.08, respectively), indicating a fast charge transfer rate. Because the hole and electron orbitals are well separated, the PET (photoinduced electron transfer) phenomena occur between complex components. At 479 nm and 415 nm, the
two excited states indicate the transfer of one electron from the

HOMO to LUMO+1. Similarly, the two excited states at 504 nm and
447 nm indicate the transfer of one electron from the HOMO to

LUMO+0.
Furthermore, at a wavelength of 386 nm, one electron transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO+3 state is observed. The PCT
(photoinduced charge transfer) and fluorescence quenching in the
emission spectrum is caused by PET mechanisms. This quenching
yields useful insights into the biological system. The charge transferring phenomena between complex GCN-curcumin fragments is
explained well by the help of PET analysis. The reduced fluorescence intensity can disclose details about the molecule as well as
its location in the biological system.


_3.10._ _Charge_ _state_ _effects_


Charged surface (positive, negative, or neutral) play a key role
in determining structural interactions with a wide range of biological molecules (like proteins and plasma membranes) [61,88]. The
effect of +1 and −1 charges on the bond length of GCN and curcumin complex is examined. Geometries of GCN with +1 and −1
charge states that have been optimized (GCN [+][1/][−][1] ) and their as


sociated complexes (GCN [+][1] -curcumin and GCN [−][1] -curcumin) are
shown in Figure S4 in the supplementary material. The bond between the N-atom and H-atom in GCN [+][1] is about 1.01 A, [˚] according to the analysis of bond distances (lengths). The lengths of C=N
bonds range from 1.31 to 1.38 A. [˚] C–N bonds have lengths ranging
from 1.38 to 1.40 A. [˚] Meanwhile, the length of the bonds between
the N and H in GCN [−][1] was determined to be around 1.01 A [˚] in a

bond-length investigation. The C=N bond lengths range from 1.31
to 1.37 A. [˚] The C–N bonds have lengths ranging from 1.39 to 1.42 A. [˚]
The resultant complex of GCN [–1/][+][1][−] Curcumin represented a tiny
bond length distribution as compared to the GCN [–1/][+][1] carrier after
curcumin adsorption on the surface of GCN [–1/][+][1], as shown from
Fig. 12. The computed bond distance for GCN [+][1], GCN [+][1] -curcumin,
GCN [−][1], and GCN [−][1] -curcumin are given in Fig. 12. The N–H weak
forces with bond distance ranging from 1.00 to 1.01 A [˚] are shown
in the ground state geometry of the GCN [+][1] -curcumin-complex. The
bond distances between C and N range from 1.39 to 1.41 A. [˚] C=N
bond length ranged from 1.31 to 1.37 A. [˚] The C–C bond distances
range between 1.46 A [˚] and 1.48 A [˚] and between C and C vary from
1.36 to 1.44. C–O, as well as in C=O that are 1.34–1.43 A [˚] and 1.23–
1.34 A, [˚] respectively. The numbers that occur around 1.08 A [˚] are the
bond lengths of C–H. Bond lengths between O–H vary from 0.96 A [˚]
to 0.97 A. [˚]
C=N bonds with lengths ranging from 1.31 to 1.37 A. [˚] C–N bonds
range in length from 1.39 to 1.43 A. [˚] The lengths of the C–C bonds
vary between 1.45 A [˚] and 1.46 A. [˚] The bond lengths of C=O are
found in the range of 1.23–1.33 A. [˚] The C=C length range from 1.34
to 1.42 A. [˚] The C–O bond distances range from 1.35 A [˚] and 1.41 A. [˚]
The numbers that occur around 1.08–1.09 A [˚] are the bond lengths
of C–H. Bond lengths between O–H vary from 0.96 A [˚] to 1.41 A. [˚]
Charge distribution on the structure reveals the type of bonds
and the locations of the key changes. As a result, the charge distribution aids in the identification of active regions in the structure for subsequent reactions. In Fig. 13, the ADCH charges for
GCN [–1/][+][1] -curcumin-complexes are given. The C and H atoms of
GCN [+][1] -curcumin have positive charge, while the N and O atoms
have negative charge. The nitrogen atoms in GCN have a negative charge (about 0.30 a.u.). Curcumin’s O-atoms have a negative
charge value of about −0.27 a.u. On the hydrogen atom of GCN [+][1] curcumin, the average charge value is in the range of 0.20 a.u. The
degree of negative charge on the O-atom and N-atom increases
in the GCN [−][1] -curcumin-complex. The number of ADCH-charge values for all other atoms is basically unchanged when the GCN [–1/][+][1] curcumin complex is utilized.

**Conclusion**


The therapeutic potential of GCN as a carrier for Curcumin in
the treatment of cardiovascular disorders was predicted using DFT
analysis. The electronic, ground, and excited-state characteristics
of GCN, Curcumin, and the GCN-curcumin-complex were examined to determine the targeted drug delivery potential of GCN.
The _E_ _ad_ of the GCN-curcumin-complex is greater in the gas phase
(−0.25 eV) than in the aqueous phase (−0.09 eV) indicates that
the GCN-curcumin-complex is stable in the gas phase. Weak N–H
bonds stabilized the GCN-curcumin complex. The GCN-curcumincomplex has a higher dipole moment (2.37 D) in the aqueous
phase. It increases the complex’s hydrophilicity in the aqueous media, which aids in the drug’s efficient transport through biological systems. The GCN-curcumin contains weak contact forces that
are responsible for offloading the Curcumin from the GCN carrier
at targeted-area. Curcumin behaves as a HOMO during excitation
and transfers the charge to LUMO (GCN), in accordance to the
MEP and FMO. The charge decomposition analysis (CDA), which
determines the highest overlap between the curcumin and GCN
orbitals, was also employed to investigate the charge transfer process. For several transitions from the donor to the acceptor, NBO
analysis revealed a process of charge transfer between the Curcumin and GCN molecules (Curcumin to GCN and GCN to Curcumin). For the GCN-curcumin-complex, excited-state calculations
found that _λ_ max is redshifted by 131 nm. The redshift of the GCNcurcumin-complex in the solvent phase is 149 nm. These theoretically generated spectra also match experimentally observed spectra
quite well. Furthermore, the in-silico infrared spectra of GCN and
Curcumin match experimental spectra well. For the explanation
of various excited states, the PET (photoinduced electron-transfer)
analysis and electron-hole theory were employed. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) process detects fluorescence quenching. Moreover, GCN [+][1/1] has a little structural change and produces
stable curcumin complexes. All findings indicated that GCN has
substantial therapeutic potential as a carrier for Curcumin in cardiovascular disease cure. Researchers will be motivated to investi
gate alternative 2D nanomaterials for drug delivery applications by
this theoretical study.
